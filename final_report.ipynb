    "## Method 1: Peak Finder\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "I implemented four peak finder algorithms (naive_logical_find_peaks, naive_mathematical_find_peaks, peak_typing_finder, noisy_find_peaks). Note that the first two naive implementations were designed by me while the other two follow from algorithms written by others. Also note that all of these algorithms can easily be converted to also identify valleys by multiplying the signal data by -1 before running the algorithm. Additionally, only noisy_find_peaks is specifically designed to handle noisy signal data like eeg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm was compared to the baseline of the MNE implementation of peaking finding on a sin wave signal and the eeg data described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. naive_logical_find_peaks – Compares if values are greater than their neighbors in the signal. The number of neighbors in the comparison is controlled by a parameter.\n",
    "2. naive_mathematical_find_peaks – Performs peak detection on three steps: 1. root mean square 2. peak to average ratios 3. first order logic. Thus, the method assumes that the underlying data follows a particular distribution, i.e. peaks will occur when the squared value of signal value divided by the root mean square (RMS) is larger than its neighbor values. By using a threshold, the algorithm attempts to handle any noise present in the dataset.\n",
    "3. peak_typing_finder – This algorithm is noteable for its time efficiency and that it handles various kinds of peaks based on edge (e.g. None, 'rising', 'falling', 'both'). Otherwise, the algorithm is quite similar to naive_logical_find_peaks. \n",
    "4. noisy_find_peaks – "
