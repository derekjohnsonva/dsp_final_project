    "## Method 1: Peak Finder\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "I implemented three peak finder algorithms (`naive_logical_find_peaks`, `naive_mathematical_find_peaks`, `peak_typing_finder`). Note that the first two naive implementations were designed by me while the other two follow from algorithms written by others. Also note that all of these algorithms can easily be converted to also identify valleys by multiplying the signal data by -1 before running the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm was compared to the baseline of the MNE implementation of peaking finding on a sin wave signal and the eeg data described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `naive_logical_find_peaks` – Compares if values are greater than their neighbors in the signal. The number of neighbors in the comparison is controlled by a parameter.\n",
    "2. `naive_mathematical_find_peaks` – Performs peak detection on three steps: 1. root mean square 2. peak to average ratios 3. first order logic. Thus, the method assumes that the underlying data follows a particular distribution, i.e. peaks will occur when the squared value of signal value divided by the root mean square (RMS) is larger than its neighbor values. By using a threshold, the algorithm attempts to handle any noise present in the dataset.\n",
    "3. `peak_typing_finder` – This algorithm is noteable for its time efficiency and that it handles various kinds of peaks based on edge (e.g. None, 'rising', 'falling', 'both'). Otherwise, the algorithm is quite similar to naive_logical_find_peaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "An examination of the MNE algorithm's code shows that it follows the following algorithm. Note that some steps have been ommitted which handle edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Initialize a minimum threshold between peaks\n",
    "    - Note that the thresholds I implemented were not between peaks. Rahter, they were minimum values for peaks or how much greater a peak had to be than its neighboring values.\n",
    "1. Use `np.diff` to calculate the change between each point in the signal (derivative).\n",
    "2. Find the indices where the derivative changes sign (peaks and valleys).\n",
    "3. Create a temporary array with only the values at these indices along with the start and end points of the signal.\n",
    "4. Find the minimum value in the array (`min_mag`).\n",
    "5. Check if start and end points should be candidates for peaks.\n",
    "6. Loop through peak candidates (peak, valley list)\n",
    "    0. Initialize the minimum magnitude for peak (`temp_mag`) as `min_mag`.\n",
    "    1. If the last value was a true peak, reset `temp_mag` to `min_mag`.\n",
    "    2. If candidate value greater than its peer by the threshold ammount. Set a new temp_mag. Add to true peak list.\n",
    "7. Return chosen candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step 6 is why it can handle noisy data better than any of my algorithms. If step 6 was removed, MNE's algorithm would be equivalent to `peak_typing_finder`."
